\colab{} \col:

Format: \stmt{col $<$col-exp$>$}

Options: $<$col-exp$>$ from \COLAB{} executable expression

Effect: \col \ calls colab with its arguments $<$col-exp$>$.
        This function is especially usefull for calling functions 
 	which are defined in the \COLAB{} toplevel and in a subsystem 
        but in a different way (e.g. \destroy). To call the 
	function $<$col-exp$>$ inside a subsystem but with its 
        semantics of the \COLAB{} toplevel use \col \ \stmt{$<$col-exp$>$}.
