\colab{} \cn:

Format: \stmt{cn $<$cn-exp$>$}

Options: $<$cn-exp$>$ from Contax executable expression

Effect: \cn \ calls contax with its argument $<$cn-exp$>$.
        This command differs from the command \stmt{(cn $<$cn-exp$>$)}
        which is a lisp function providing a small number of 
        access-primitives implementing a well-defined interface 
        between the \COLAB{} subsystems. For the syntax of Contax 
        expressions refer to the Contax Manual, or the help function
	in Contax.
