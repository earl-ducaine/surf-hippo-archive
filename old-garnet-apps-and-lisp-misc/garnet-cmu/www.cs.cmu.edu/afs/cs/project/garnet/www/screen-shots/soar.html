The Developmental Soar Interface provides a graphical and
textual interface to observe and modify models (programs) for Soar, an
AI programming language that also realizes a unified theory of
cognition.  Garnet is used to graphically represent Soar's goal stack
and internal state, and to help users modify and observe structures in
Soar.
