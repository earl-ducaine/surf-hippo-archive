\stmb{fw-compile}:

Format: \stmt{fw-compile $<$op$>$ }

Options: $<$op$>$ an operator

Effect: If an operator is given only the matching rules of \stmt{*rule-database*} are 
	regarded otherwise all rules of \stmt{*rule-database*} are splitted. The
	resulting up-rules will be horizontally and vertically compiled into the
	extended \WAM{}. The resulting horn-rules and the \stmt{*factbase*} are 
	vertically compiled.
