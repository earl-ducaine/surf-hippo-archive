Garnet was developed between 1987 and 1994 by the User Interface Software Group in the 
<a href="http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/">
Human Computer Interaction Institute <img border="0" src="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/bam/www/hcii_vsmall_dot_only.gif" width="44" height="50"></a>
in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.
The primary research interest of the UISG is the
development of tools to allow rapid development of graphical user
interfaces.
<p>
Garnet is a user interface development environment for Common Lisp and
X11 or Macintosh.  It helps you create graphical, interactive user interfaces 
for your software.
<p>
<i>Unfortunately, the UISG is no longer able to support Garnet.  See
our 
<A HREF="letter-no-support.html">
letter</A>
about why. However, some people are still using it (see below). There is
still a Garnet-Users mailing list. Send mail to <a href="mailto:garnet-users-request@cs.cmu.edu">garnet-users-request@cs.cmu.edu</a>
to be added or removed.</I>
<p>
The UISG then developed another tool, called 
<A HREF="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/amulet/www/amulet-home.html">Amulet</A>,
which is a successor to Garnet.  
Amulet is a C++ environment which
incorporates the best ideas of Garnet, and also supports
gestures and other features.  Amulet is
be portable across X/11, Windows and the Macintosh.
<A HREF="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/amulet/www/amulet-home.html">Click here</A>
for more information on Amulet. <i>(But Amulet is no longer supported either.)</i>
<hr>
<i>Does anyone use Garnet anymore?</i>
<p>
<B>Maybe.</b><br>
The Garnet-Users@cs.cmu.edu mailing list still had about 60 names on it (as
of May'2002). People seem to be using Garnet for various projects, and making it
work in new versions of Lisp. Send mail to <a href="mailto:garnet-users-request@cs.cmu.edu">garnet-users-request@cs.cmu.edu</a>
to be added or removed.
<p>
<b>There is a SourceForge project for Garnet (established May, 2002 by Cliff Yapp),
with complete source code and updates:</b>

</ul>
Fred Gilman also maintains an unofficial distribution based on Garnet
3.0 to which he applies all the patches he can get his hands on:
<ul>
<li>

Here is one example project:

Garnet is a large scale system containing many
features and parts:

<li> Two complete widget sets        
	<ul>
       	<li> One with a

	     implemented in Lisp, and one with a custom look and feel
        </ul>
<li> <A HREF="tools.html"> Interactive design tools</A> for creating 
parts of the interface without writing code

There is a problem with "true-color" screen support. This 
problem is fixed in Fred Gilham's &lt;gilham@csl.sri.com&gt; version
(thanks to Paolo for this information. It did not solved my problem
with clisp but it did solve the color problem.):<br>

In this version (maybe it should be called garnet-3.0.x) the pixmap
problem is partially solved. Garnet was not able to load pixmaps with 
depth > 8. Now It displays correctly the first half of the pixmap!
