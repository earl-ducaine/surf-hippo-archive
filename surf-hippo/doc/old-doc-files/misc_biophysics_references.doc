 Review of Channel Conductance Data (from Hille, 1984 p.222)


	Synapse Channels --

 Excitatory (Cation-permeable) Channels
									- pS -
	Ach - agonist
		Amphibian, reptile, bird and mammalian endplate		20-40
		Rat Myotubules						49
		Bovine Chromaffin cells					44
		Aplysia ganglion					8
	Glutamate - agonist
		Locust Muscle						120-130

 Inhibitory (Chloride-permeable) Channels

	Glycine - agonist
		Lamprey brain stem neurons				73
		Cultured Mouse spinal neurons				30
	GABA - agonist
		Cultured Mouse spinal neurons				18
		Crayfish Muscle						 9

	Non-Synaptic Channels --

 Na channels range from approximately 4 - 20 pS per channel.
 K channels range from approximately 2 - 200 pS per channel.


 Membrane density is highest for receptor proteins, up to 10,000 per square micron.
 In comparison typical channel densities for Na and K channels range roughly from 1 - 2000 per square micron.

 For modelling purposes, then reasonable ranges for conductance density parameters are as follows:

	Excitatory Channels (Cholinergic) -- 1 - 100,000 ps per square micron
	Excitatory Channels (Glutamerigic) -- 100 - 100,000 ps per square micron

 Compare these values to typical values of membrane resistivity:

 10,000 ohms-cm-cm = 1 ps/sq-uM
 40,000 ohms-cm-cm = 0.25 ps/sq-uM
 100,000 ohms-cm-cm = 0.1 ps/sq-uM
