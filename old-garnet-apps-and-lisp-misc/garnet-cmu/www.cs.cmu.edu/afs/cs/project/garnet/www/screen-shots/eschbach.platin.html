<P>

Automated theorem provers normally need interaction with the user to
be successful on non-trivial problems.  To enhance the degree of
automation for a prover the domain of interest is drastically
restricted and knowledge about this domain of interest is integrated
into the control component of the prover. Such knowledge may consist
of typical proof methods and frequently used proof schemes. Therefore
the usage of such provers even in very similar domains necessitates
major changes in the prover.  In PLATIN we propose an architecture for
proof-planning that allows one to easily introduce knowledge about the
domains of interest and that is to a large extent independent of the
basic prover. The knowledge about a domain of interest is represented
in such a way that it can be used to decompose the problem into
several subproblems. This decomposition of the problem can be repeated
until the subproblems become so small that they can be handled by the
basic prover, called verifier.
