Graphical Interval Logic (GIL) is a visual language for temporal reasoning
that provides an intuitive notation for representing the relative ordering 
of events in a system and the manner in which the predicates that represent 
system properties change with time. The high-level constructs provided by 
GIL together with its visual appeal result in specifications that are easier 
to understand and to use than traditional temporal logics. A prototype 
graphical toolkit that supports the use of GIL has been implemented. It 
includes a graphical syntax-directed editor that enables one to construct 
and edit GIL formulas. The toolkit is intended for the formal specification
and verification of concurrent and real-time systems. It supports a unique 
verification methodology in which the specifications, proofs and 
counterexamples are all represented pictorially. The visual interface of the 
toolkit and the syntax-directed editor are implemented using Garnet.
