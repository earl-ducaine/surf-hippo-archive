\colab{} \listing:

Format: \stmt{listing}\\
        \stmt{listing $<$op$>$}\\
        \stmt{listing $<$pat$>$}

Options: $<$op$>$ an operator,\\
         $<$pat$>$ a head pattern

Effect: Global listing function. Shows the knowledge items of all 
        databases in \COLAB. If no argument is given, the whole 
        databases will be printed on the terminal. If an operator 
        is given, only those knowledge items in the databases will 
        be printed which use this operator as their procedure name. 
        If a pattern is given, only those knowledge items in the 
        databases will be printed whose head matches the pattern 
        $<$pat$>$ (the latter form is not implemented for all 
        subsystems).
