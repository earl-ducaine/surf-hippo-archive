\colab{} \rf:

Format: \stmt{rf $<$rf-exp$>$}

Options: $<$rf-exp$>$ from Relfun executable expressions

Effect: \rf \ calls Relfun with its arguments $<$rf-exp$>$.
        This command differs from the command \stmt{(rf $<$rf-exp$>$)}
        which is a lisp function providing a small number of 
        access-primitives implementing a well-defined interface 
        between the \COLAB{} subsystems. For the syntax of Relfun 
        expressions refer to the Relfun Manual, or the help function 
        in Relfun.
