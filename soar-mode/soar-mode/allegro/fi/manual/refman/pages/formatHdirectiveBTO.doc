    FORMAT DIRECTIVE
    ~O  -  print integer in octal radix

    USAGE
    ~mincol,padchar,commachar[:][@]O

    DESCRIPTION
    Prints the next format argument in octal (base 8) if it is  an  integer,
    and  in  ``~A''  format  with octal base (if applicable) otherwise.  The
    sign is not printed unless the number is negative or the ``@''  modifier
    is given.

    The prefix parameter MINCOL (default 0) specifies that enough copies  of
    the  padding  character,  PADCHAR (default the space character `` '') be
    added to the beginning of the output string to make it consume at  least
    MINCOL  columns.   If  the  ``:''  modifier  is  given,  the  character,
    COMMACHAR (default ``,'') appears between every three digits.

    EXAMPLES
    (format nil "Enter ~O now." 9) => "Enter 11 now."
    (format nil "Enter ~O now." '(a b)) => "Enter (a b) now."
    (format nil "Enter ~6O now." -15) => "Enter    -17 now."
    (format nil "Enter ~:O now." 4095) => "Enter 7,777 now."
