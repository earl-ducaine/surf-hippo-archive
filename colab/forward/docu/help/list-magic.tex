Format: \stmt{list-magic}\\
        \stmt{list-magic $<$op$>$}\\
        \stmt{list-magic $<$pat$>$}

Options: $<$op$>$ an operator,\\

	\stmt{*magic-seeds*}.  If no argument is given, both databases will be

	as their procedure name.  If a pattern is given, only those knowledge 
	items in the databases will be printed whose head matches the pattern 
	$<$pat$>$.
