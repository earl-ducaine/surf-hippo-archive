\indexing:

Format: \stmt{indexing \{ on | off | 
		 :min-clauses $<$no$>$ | 
		 :max-vars $<$no$>$ | :max-depth $<$no$>$ | 
		 :max-args $<$no$>$ |
		 :debug on | :debug off \} } 

Effect: 
   without any option display current settings,\\
   \stmt{on (off)} switches indexing on (off),\\
   \stmt{:min-clauses $<$no$>$} sets the minimal number of clauses
	  for an indexable operator definition to $<$no$>$,\\
   \stmt{:max-vars $<$no$>$} sets the maximal number of variables
	  allowed in a constant block (block-variable-size) to $<$no$>$,\\
   \stmt{:max-depth $<$no$>$} sets the maximal depth of the index
	  tree to $<$no$>$,\\
   \stmt{:max-args $<$no$>$} sets the maximal number of parallelly
	  indexable arguments (index tree breadth) to $<$no$>$,\\
   \stmt{:debug on (off)}: for internal use only

Mutually excluding options result in executing only the last one.

Example: \\
\stmt{indexing off :min-clauses 5 on :debug off} :\\
switches indexing on, debugging off and sets min-clauses to 5.
