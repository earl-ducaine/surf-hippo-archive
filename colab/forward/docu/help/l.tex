\stmb{l}:

Format: \stmt{l}\\
        \stmt{l $<$op$>$}\\
        \stmt{l $<$pat$>$}

Options: $<$op$>$ an operator,\\
         $<$pat$>$ a head pattern

Effect: Shows the knowledge items of the databases \stmt{*rule-database*}, \stmt{*factbase*}
	and \stmt{*derived-factbase*}. If no argument is given, the whole databases 
	will be printed on the terminal. If an operator $<$op$>$ is given, only those 
	knowledge items in the databases will be printed which use this operator
	as their procedure name. If a pattern is given, only those knowledge 
	items in the databases will be printed whose head matches the pattern 
	$<$pat$>$.
