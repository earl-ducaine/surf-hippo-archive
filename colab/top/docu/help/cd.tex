\colab{} \cd:

Format: \stmt{cd}\\
        \stmt{cd $<$dir$>$}

Options: $<$dir$>$ a directory pathname

Effect: Function for changing the current directory.
	\cd \ without arguments switches to the directory from where 
	\COLAB{} has been started. 
	If a global directory pathname (beginning with "/") is provided
	the string which contains the current path is changed to $<$dir$>$.
	Otherwise $<$dir$>$ is added to the current pathname. No checks 
	about the physical existence of these pathnames are made.
	If the provided pathname contains capital letters, they are
	transformed in small letters. To avoid this or if $<$dir$>$
        contains .. or . one must use quotation marks.
