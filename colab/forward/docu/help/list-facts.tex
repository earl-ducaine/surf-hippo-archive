\stmb{list-facts}:

Format: \stmt{list-facts}\\
        \stmt{list-facts $<$op$>$}\\
        \stmt{list-facts $<$pat$>$}

Options: $<$op$>$ an operator,\\
         $<$pat$>$ a head pattern

Effect: Shows the knowledge items of the databases \stmt{*factbase*} and 
	\stmt{*derived-factbase*}. If no argument is given, both databases will 
	be printed on the terminal. If an operator $<$op$>$ is given, only those 
	knowledge items in the database will be printed which use this operator
	as their procedure name. If a pattern is given, only those knowledge
	items in the database will be printed whose head matches the pattern
	$<$pat$>$.
