    FORMAT DIRECTIVE
    ~D  -  print integer in decimal radix

    USAGE
    ~mincol,padchar,commachar[:][@]D

    DESCRIPTION
    Prints the next format argument in decimal if it is an integer,  and  in
    ``~A''  format  with a decimal base (if applicable) otherwise.  It never
    prints a decimal point after the number, and the  sign  is  not  printed
    unless the number is negative or the ``@'' modifier is given.

    The prefix parameter MINCOL (default 0) specifies that enough copies  of
    the  padding  character  PADCHAR  (default the space character `` '') be
    printed at the beginning of the output  to  make  it  consume  at  least
    MINCOL  columns.   If  the  ``:''  modifier  is  given,  the  character,
    COMMACHAR (default ``,'') appears between every three digits.

    EXAMPLES
    (format nil "Enter ~D now." 92) => "Enter 92 now."
    (format nil "Enter ~D now." '(a b)) => "Enter (a b) now."
    (format nil "Enter ~6D now." -92) => "Enter    -92 now."
    (format nil "Enter ~9,'0:@D now." 4096) => "Enter 000+4,096 now."
