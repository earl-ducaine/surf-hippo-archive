The lisp executables in this directory are specific to machine
architectures and operating systems, as is the associated image file
(in the top-level directory). The executable actually used is
specified in the surf-hippo script in the top-level surf-hippo
directory, e.g.:

  #!/bin/sh

  cd $SURFHOME
  lisp=cmucl/cmucl18a-sunos.4.1.3
  exec $lisp "$@" -core image -eval '(load "loaders/initial-message.lisp" :verbose nil)'
