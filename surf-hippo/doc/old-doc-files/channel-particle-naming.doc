    Naming Conventions for Channels and Particles

************************************************************



The following is a suggested method for naming ion channels and their
associated gating particles. Most (not all) of the channels and
particles included with the simulator follow this method.


	Channel Name:

	(ion type)(channel type reference)-(literature reference)


	Particle Name:

	(ion type)(channel type reference)(particle type reference)-(literature reference)


For example, the DR potassium channel used in "Computer simulations of
a morphologically reconstructed CA3 hippocampal neuron", by Migliore
et. al., is named 

	KDR-MIG


and the two gating particle types associated with it are named

	KDRN-MIG and KDRL-MIG

where the "N" and "L" are taken from the formulation in the paper.
