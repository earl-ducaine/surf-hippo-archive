The SAGE project is developing systems which automate the process of
designing presentations of information.  An automatic presentation system is
an intelligent interface component which receives information from a user or
application program and designs a combination of graphics and text that
effectively conveys it.  It's  purpose is to assume as much responsibility
for designing displays as required by a user, from layout and color
decisions to broader decisions about the types of charts, tables and
networks that can be composed within a display.  The SAGE project is
developing an interactive data exploration environment which contains
automatic display design capabilities integrated with data navigation,
manipulation and modification tools. These tools are being used to
explore large amounts of diverse data from marketing, logistical, real
estate, census and other databases.
