\colab{} \fw:

Format: \stmt{fw $<$fw-exp$>$}

Options: $<$fw-exp$>$ from Forward executable expressions

Effect: \fw \ calls Forward with its arguments $<$fw-exp$>$.
        This command differs from the command \stmt{(fw $<$fw-exp$>$)}
        which is a lisp function providing a small number of 
        access-primitives implementing a well-defined interface between
	the \COLAB{} subsystems. For the syntax of Forward expressions
	refer to the Forward Manual, or the help function in Forward.
