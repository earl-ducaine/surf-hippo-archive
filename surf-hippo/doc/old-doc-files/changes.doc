The arguments and results of ALPHA-ARRAY, ALPHA (an alias for
ALPHA-ARRAY) and ALPHA-FUNCTION (all in waveforms.lisp) have changed
and are not backward compatible. Accordingly, the entries in
synapse-params.lisp and light-synapse-params.lisp have been changed.

In particular, the default optional arguments for the old
ALPHA-FUNCTION gave an alpha function with unit area, whereas the
default value for the key argument :ADJUSTMENT is :NORMALIZE, which
gives an alpha function of amplitude 1.0. Adding the arguments
	
	:ADJUSTMENT :UNIT-AREA 

to old code that calls ALPHA-FUNCTION will update to this change.

	Format For *SOURCE-PULSE-LISTS*

*******************************************************
*******************************************************


The format for *SOURCE-PULSE-LISTS* has changed, so that now you do
not add the type of the source as a cons at the front of each entry in
the list. For example, the old format was

	((("Hippo-soma-isrc" . 'isource) (10.0 20.0 2.0) (100.0 110.0 -5.0)))


and now this is


	(("Hippo-soma-isrc" (10.0 20.0 2.0) (100.0 110.0 -5.0)))


This change is necessary for all code.
