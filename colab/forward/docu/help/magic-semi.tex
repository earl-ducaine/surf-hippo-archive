Format: \stmt{magic-semi $<$goal$1>$ ... $<$goal$n>$}

Options: $<$goal$1>$ ... $<$goal$n>$ the initial seeds for magic sets evaluation.

Effect: The databases \stmt{*magic-rules*} ,\stmt{*factbase*} and \stmt{*derived-factbase*} will be 
	evaluated wrt. the given goals using the semi-naive bottom-up strategy. 
	If no goals are given, the database \stmt{*magic-seeds*} (all seeds of 
        the transformation) is taken for evaluation.
