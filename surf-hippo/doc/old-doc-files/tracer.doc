Tracing Images System

*************************************
*************************************

Data scanned from other sources can be loaded into the Surf-Hippo
system, calibrated and hand traced with the following steps.


1. Original image -> scanned into xbm (X11 bitmap) format file "foo.xbm"

2. Run 
	(show-scanned-image "foo.xbm") <- Normally use the full pathname

Calibration steps include setting the Y and X magnitudes, and then the
absolute placement of the trace via defining the XY origin.

Control-M produces a menu for scanned image windows.


3.  Use the function

	grab-and-store-plot-data &optional FILENAME

to store the data to file.
