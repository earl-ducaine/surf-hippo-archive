    ;;; Written by Joseph Bates, CMU CSD, March 1988. jbates+@cs.cmu.edu

    ;;;

and (from psgraph.doc)

    Here is a brief summary of how to use the PSgrapher.

    The PSgrapher is a set of Lisp routines that can be called to
    produce Postscript commands to display a directed acyclic graph.
    It uses the same basic algorithm as the ISI Grapher.  It is slower
    than the ISI grapher, but produces much prettier output than using
    Xdump to copy an ISI Grapher screen image to a Postscript printer.
    It also allows arbitrary information to be displayed with a node,
    and can print as many output pages as are necessary to accomodate
    large graphs (subject to Postscript printer limits, typically one
    or two thousand nodes).

    The PSgrapher is small enough and easy enough to use to be included
    in other systems without pain.  It is also free and not
    copyrighted.
