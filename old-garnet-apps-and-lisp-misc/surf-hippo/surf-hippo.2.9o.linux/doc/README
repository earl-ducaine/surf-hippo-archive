	Quick Guide to the Surf-Hippo Documentation Directory
			  and Other Pointers

************************************************************************

This directory contains the Surf-Hippo documentation set. User queries will
profoundly influence the growth rate of given branches.

Of particular interest are draft versions of the User Manual and
Reference Manual.

For installing Surf-Hippo, see the surf-hippo/doc/installation directory.

Various related documentation from outside sources are found in
surf-hippo/doc/outside_docs/.

The source code (in the subdirectories under surf-hippo/src) is fairly well
commented, which is especially useful in understanding the nature of various
circuit elements.

Older doc files, most of which have been incorporated into the User
Manual, may be found in the old-doc-files directory.

If there is a reference to a Surf-Hippo function whose source code can't be
found, you can try the DESCRIBE function. For example, if you looked at the
file surf-hippo/src/hippocampus/hippos.lisp and saw a call to

  (make-soma-segment-chain soma "a" 4 100 1 '(auto-fast) '(43 22 103))

and you wondered what this function did, then from Lisp, you would enter:

     * (describe 'make-soma-segment-chain)
     MAKE-SOMA-SEGMENT-CHAIN is an internal symbol in the SURF-HIPPO package.
     Function: #<Function MAKE-SOMA-SEGMENT-CHAIN {23F2DD9}>
     Function arguments:
       (soma chain-name total-segs seg-length seg-diam synapse-types synapse-segs &key
	(proximal-phi 0.0))
     Its defined argument types are:
       (T T T T T T T &KEY (:PROXIMAL-PHI T))
     Its result type is:
       NULL
     On Monday, 2/6/95 07:35:20 pm EST it was compiled from:
     /home/surf-hippo/src/sys/trees.lisp
       Created: Tuesday, 12/27/94 03:44:32 pm EST
     * 


Depending on the documentation in the function definition, this may be
sufficient. Otherwise, DESCRIBE tells you which source file to look at
(in this case surf-hippo/src/sys/trees.lisp).
