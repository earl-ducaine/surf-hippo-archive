Line Styles

Some notes on line styles:

There are a few places in which the function 

	access-*line-styles* THICKNESS COLOR &optional (SHADING 100) (DASH 0)

is used to retrieve a line style. In this case, the arguments to the above may have the
following values:

	thickness - 0 to 20
	color - 'red 'green 'blue 'yellow 'orange 'cyan 'purple 'black 'white
	shading -   100 50 25 12.5 6.25
	dash -  0 1 '(15 15) '(7 3) '(9 3 5 3) '(10 10) '(5 5) '(2 2) 

For dash, 0 means a solid line, 1 is a dash with one pixel ON and one pixel OFF, and the
remaining lists refer to the number of pixels ON and OFF, alternating.

The following are some places which use this method:
