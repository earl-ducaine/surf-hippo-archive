		Data Folder

****************************************************************


The Data Folder allows the storage of (plotted) simulation variables
immediately after a simulation run (from the main menu, select the
"Immediate information output" option). This folder keeps track of the
simulation names and time bases, so that later on the traces may be
replotted with reference to their original simulation name (from the
main menu, select the "Edit plot parameters" option). This is
convenient, for example, for comparing various traces after several
simulations. For plotting, data in the folder may be organized
according to the simulation run or according to the type of data
(determined by the units of the data, e.g. mV).



If the variable *STORE-PLOT-RESULTS-TO-FOLDER* is set, then all the
plotted traces will be stored automatically to the data folder after
each simulation run.
