\colab{} \tx:

Format: \stmt{tx $<$tx-exp$>$}

Options: $<$tx-exp$>$ from Taxon executable expression

Effect: \tx \ calls Taxon with its argument $<$tx-exp$>$.
        This command differs from the command \stmt{(tx $<$tx-exp$>$)}
        which is a lisp function providing a small number of 
        access-primitives implementing a well-defined interface between
	the \COLAB{} subsystems. For the syntax of Taxon expressions
	refer to the Taxon Manual, or the help function in Taxon.
