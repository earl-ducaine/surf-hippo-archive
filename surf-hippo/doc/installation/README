This directory contains information on installing Surf-Hippo. For most
users, the information in installation.doc should be sufficient. 

Surf-Hippo requires that certain Unix environment variables be
set. This may be done in the appropriate shell initialization file,
and examples are given in the .bashrc-stuff and .cshrc-stuff files.

If Surf-Hippo is to be run out of Emacs using Ilisp, there are
initializations that should be included in your .emacs or other Emacs
initialization file - see the .emacs-stuff file.
