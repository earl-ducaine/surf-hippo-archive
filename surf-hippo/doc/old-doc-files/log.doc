	LOG FILES

***************************************************************
***************************************************************


Every time a simulation is run, if the global variable *WRITE-LOG-FILE* is T (default), a
file named LOG-DIRECTORY/X_Y_Z.log is referenced, created if it does not exist, and
appended with a short summary of the simulation. LOG-DIRECTORY is given by the global
variable *SURF-USER-DIR* (default is the value of the UNIX environment variables
SURFUSERHOME or SURFHOME) concatenated with "/logs/", and X_Y_Z is the day_month_year. For
example, if $SURFHOME was the reference directory, then a log file could be called
surf-hippo/logs/8_2_95.log.

The purpose of these files is to provide a convenient editable record of all simulations
run. If the current log file is edited, however, be sure that the simulator does not
overwrite the file while you are editing it. These files are similar to .info files, with
the difference being that these files are always written (according to *WRITE-LOG-FILE*),
and that this format can be more convenient for keeping a running commentary of a series
of simulations.
