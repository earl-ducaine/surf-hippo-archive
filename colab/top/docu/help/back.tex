\colab{} \back:

Format: \stmt{back}

Options: none

Effect: After calling this command, the \COLAB{}-system goes back to the
        last invoked subsystem. As the \COLAB{} prompt contains a list of
	all already called subsystems, a call of \back \ switches 
	to the last but one subsystem in the prompt.
