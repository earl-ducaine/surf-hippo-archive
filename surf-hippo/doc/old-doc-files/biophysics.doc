Biophysical Details

**************************************

This file contains information on some biophysical details that may be
relevant to but not mentioned fully in other doc files.



**************************************
Temperature Dependence
**************************************

See also channel.doc and synapse.doc. Q10s (and associated reference
temperatures) may be defined for channels, particles and synapses,
which in turn define the temperature dependence for channel maximum
conductances, particle kinetics, and synaptic maximum conductances,
respectively, when the global variable *IGNORE-Q10* is NIL (default).
The simulation temperature is set by either the global variable
*TEMPERATURE* (in degrees Kelvin, 300.0 default) or *Temp-celcius* (in
degrees Celcius, 27.0 default). If an element does not have a explicit
Q10 factor, then the default is 1.0 (i.e. no temperature dependence).

Q10 coefficients are calculated by the particular Q10 constant raised
to (T-Tbase)/10, where T is the temperature of the simulation, and
Tbase is the reference temperature of the measured Q10.

It is important to remember the provision above for CONDUCTANCE
temperature dependence, in addition to the more common dependence of
particle/gating kinetics on temperature. 

Relevant functions (in biophysics.lisp) include:


	QTEN-TAU-FACTOR This calculates the qten factor for time constants (as
	temperature goes up, tau goes down).

		qten-tau-factor REFERENCE-TEMP TEMP QTEN &optional (IGNORE-Q10 *IGNORE-Q10*)


	QTEN-RATE-FACTOR This calculates the qten factor for rate constants
	(as temperature goes up, so does rate).

		qten-rate-factor REFERENCE-TEMP TEMP QTEN &optional (IGNORE-Q10 *IGNORE-Q10*)

**************************************
Changing Temperature in Scripts
**************************************

If the temperature is changed between simulations by explicit setting
either the global variable *TEMPERATURE* or *TEMP-CELCIUS* then
UPDATE-TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT-PARAMETERS is called automatically at the
beginning of the simulation.


**************************************
     Somatic I-V Characteristic
**************************************

In analysis.lisp,

	plot-iv &optional CELL

	plot-ivs &optional CELLS

The functions PLOT-IV and PLOT-IVS (analysis.lisp) plots simple
steady-state somatic current-voltage relationships for the loaded
cells. If the optional arguments are not supplied then PLOT-IV plots
the characteristic for the last created cell, and PLOT-IVS presents a
menu to choose a cell or cells. IV relations are calulated using the
following assumptions:

 1. Passive dendritic tree (any channels in the tree are disabled).

 2. Steady-state calcium concentrations, assuming the somatic
    potential is at resting potential 

 3. Measurement made under ideal (somatic) voltage clamp

These functions can be invoked from the menus.

If there are any non-somatic non-linearities, more realistic I-V
curves require an explicit set of (somatic) voltage clamp simulations,
and collection of the corresponding clamp voltages and currents.


**************************************
	Spines
**************************************


The function GROW-SPINES (trees.lisp) adjusts membrane resistivities
and capacitances to fold-in "virtual" spines, under the assumption
that the voltage drop or other compartmentalization of the spine neck
is negligible:

	grow-spines NECK-LENGTH NECK-DIAMETER HEAD-DIAMETER DENSITY
				&key CELL-TYPE-NAME SEGMENTS
				(UPDATE-LINEAR-PARAMETERS T)

The spine model here is of a cylindrical neck capped by a spherical
head. Spine area is given by the area of the neck (not including ends)
plus the area of the head minus the area of the neck end (to partially
compensate for the junction between the head and neck).

If SEGMENTS is a list of segments, then a 'MEMBRANE-AREA-COEFFICIENT entry
is added to the :SEGMENT-PARAMETERS a-list of each segment, otherwise
if CELL-TYPE-NAME is supplied, the :DENDRITE-SPECIFIC-CAPACITANCE and
:MEMBRANE-RESISTIVITY slots of the referred cell type are adjusted,
otherwise (if both keyword args are NIL) the
:DENDRITE-SPECIFIC-CAPACITANCE and :MEMBRANE-RESISTIVITY slots of all
the cell types are adjusted. NECK-LENGTH, NECK-DIAMETER, HEAD-DIAMETER
are in microns. DENSITY is number of spines per square micron of
dendrite (non-spine) membrane. The update-linear-parameters argument
controls whether or not the membrane parameters for the individual
segment structures and the linear input parameters for the cells are
updated to reflect the addition of the virtual spines.

Using the SEGMENTS argument allows a variable spine density for a
given cell, while reference to the CELL-TYPE-NAME (or all cell types)
implies that the spine density is constant throughout the dendritic
tree. This function *does not* add virtual spines to the soma. 

More elaborate spines may be modeled by appropriate anatomical
construction using calls to CREATE-SEGMENT.
