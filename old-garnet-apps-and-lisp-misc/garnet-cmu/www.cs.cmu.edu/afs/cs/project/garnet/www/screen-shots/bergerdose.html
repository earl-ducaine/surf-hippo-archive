Roentgen is a case-based aid to radiation therapy planning.  It relies on
an archive of past therapy cases to suggest plans for new therapy
patients. Roentgen supports therapy planning by: 1) retrieving the case
which best matches the geometry and treatment constraints of the new
patient; 2) tailoring the plan to the specific details of the patient;
3) evaluating the results of applying the plan; 4) repairing the plan
to avoid any discovered faults in treatment results. This final plan
is the system's suggestion to the human planner. Roentgen breaks new
ground in solving problems in a domain dominated by spatial reasoning
and the satisficing of constraints.
