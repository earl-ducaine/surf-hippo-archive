Although detailed axon models may be constructed with segments and the appropriate channels (see
thre Rallpack-3 functions for example), there is also a AXON element which is included to model
axonal communication much more efficiently. The waveform of the AXON's spike is predefined (as part
of the AXON-TYPE), and the final output voltage of the AXON is a superposition of this canonical
waveform, shifted according to the starting (oints (trigger times) for individual spikes.

The basic function for adding an axon is

	create-axon PROXIMAL-CELL-ELEMENT AXON-TYPE-SYMBOL 
		    &key (LENGTH 0.0) TARGET-SYNAPSE (DELAY 0.0)
		    (DISTANCE-COEFF 1.0)
		    (CONSIDER-MID-POINTS-FOR-LENGTH NIL)
	            MID-POINTS

An AXON is controlled by the voltage of the proximal cell element (i.e. soma or segment). If
the length argument evaluates to 0, then the length of the AXON is derived as follows. If there
are no :MID-POINTS, or if :CONSIDER-MID-POINTS-FOR-LENGTH is NIL, then the length is taken from
the straight line distance between the PROXIMAL-CELL-ELEMENT and the TARGET-SYNAPSE, multiplied
by :DISTANCE-COEFF. Otherwise, the length is taken from the line between the
PROXIMAL-CELL-ELEMENT and the TARGET-SYNAPSE via the mid-points.  The form of the mid-points is
a list of XYZ location point lists, e.g.:

	'((102.0 0.0 -34.0) (421.4 92.0 1.0))

There can be any number of mid-points.

Axons do have nodes, so that accessing their voltage is the same as for segments and somas, but
these nodes are not considered part of the core circuit (the :IS-PHYSICAL-CELL-NODE slot is NIL
for these nodes) since they are not part of the circuit equations. Both the
PROXIMAL-CELL-ELEMENT and TARGET-SYNAPSE arguments may be either structures of the appropriate
type (SOMA, SEGMENT or AXON in the former case, SYNAPSE for the latter) or the name of one.

The main use of AXONs is to provide input to synapse types which either are controlled by the
voltage of some pre-synaptic element, or a channel (which in turn is controlled by the voltage of
some pre-synpatic element). In either case, the pre-synaptic node can point to an AXON, as well as
to a SEGMENT or a SOMA. An AXON can be created before a target synapse, in which case the subsequent
CREATE-SYNAPSE call will include a reference to the AXON (see synapse.doc).

The AXON-TYPE-SYMBOL argument references a type description stored with the macro AXON-TYPE-DEF -
see axon-params.lisp. The format for each entry in the axon type parameters association list, as
shown in this file, is:

 (type (parameter-1 . value)(parameter-2 . value)(parameter-3 . value) ... )

where the TYPE symbol is that used in the call to CREATE-AXON. 


The initiation of a spike occurs when the voltage of the AXON's proximal node is above the
AXON-TYPE-INPUT-THRESHOLD, for a time greater than AXON-TYPE-SUPRA-THRESHOLD-DURATION-MIN. If there
was an earlier spike, then the conditions for the inititation of a subsequent spike are not checked
until after AXON-TYPE-REFRACTORY-PERIOD milliseconds after the last spike.

The output waveform for a given spike, i, contributes to the AXON voltage starting at:
  
  t_0_i = t_init_i + propagation-delay + delay

where

   propagation-delay = (axon_length / adjusted-propagation-velocity)

and t_init_i is the time of the initiation of the spike. The adjusted-propagation-velocity is
derived from the propagation-velocity and temperature dependencies of the AXON-TYPE. The (absolute)
delay is also taken from the AXON-TYPE.


Spikes along an axon may be summed at the output (if they are fast enough so that the output
waveforms overlap in time). Thus, the axon voltage V at time t is given by:

   V(t) = sum_over_i (output_waveform[t-t_0_i])
  
At the end of a simulation, the axon has a list of spike times, whichis a list of axonal spike
initiation times at the proximal node of the axon. Also, if the axon is to be plotted, the final
voltage waveform is saved.


An axon type is characterized by the following:

	(delay 0.0 :type single-float)        ; milliseconds

	(propagation-velocity 1.0 :type single-float) ; meter/second. 
	
	qten	

	reference-temperature for the velocity

		Axon Graphics and More On Mid-Points

****************************************************************
****************************************************************

Axons that are assigned to a post-synaptic element (target-synapse) are by default drawn as a
straight line between the proximal-cell-element and the synapse. However, if mid-points are
assigned to the axon, then the axon is drawn from the proximal-cell-element to the synapse via
the mid-points.

As discussed above, mid-points may be included in the call to CREATE-AXON, or may be explicitly
pushed onto the the axon's :PARAMETERS slot -

	(push '(mid-points ((0.0 0.0 0.0)(179.0 -348.0 0.0)))
	 	(axon-parameters (element "Axon-Hippo-1-soma-SIMPLE")))

Either with :CONSIDER-MID-POINTS-FOR-LENGTH argument in create-axon, or if the following flag is
pushed onto the the axon's :PARAMETERS slot (e.g.) -

	(push '(CONSIDER-MID-POINTS-FOR-LENGTH t)
		(axon-parameters (element "Axon-Hippo-1-soma-SIMPLE")))

then the length of the axon used for determining its propagation delay considers the path over
the mid-points. Otherwise, the mid-points are used *just* for the graphics. This option is
useful mainly for clarity (merci N.G.).


The color of an axon may be taken from the color assigned to the target synapse; otherwise the
default color is chosen from the histology axon menu.

	 Graphics Diameter of Axons

****************************************************************
****************************************************************

The global variable *AXON-GRAPHICS-DIAMETER* (default 1.0 micron) sets
the diameter of the drawn axons. This diameter has *no* effect on the
electrical properties of the axons.
