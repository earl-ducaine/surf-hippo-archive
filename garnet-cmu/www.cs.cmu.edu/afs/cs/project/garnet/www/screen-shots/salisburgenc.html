The Electronic Encyclopedia is an electronic
how-things-work book.  It allows the user to learn about devices by
experimenting with the components of those devices in a lab simulation
setting.  A causal model simulator lies beneath the user interface
which simulates the current device and can provide causal explanations
of the results of that simulation.  Other high-level tools are planned
for future enhancement.
