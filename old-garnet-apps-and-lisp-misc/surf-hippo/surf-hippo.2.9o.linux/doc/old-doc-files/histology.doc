		Basic Interface

****************************************************************
****************************************************************


The main histology graphics menu may be invoked from either the Main
Menu, by the histology graphics window CONTROL-m option, or by
invoking the function (HISTOLOGY) at the lisp prompt.

Note that if the cell(s) in a histology window is(are) no longer
loaded into Surf-Hippo, then modification, selection of cell elements,
etc, is disabled.

The options in this menu or in its submenus include variations on the
following:

 "Viewing angle theta (degrees; For retina, 0 is for flat mount; 90 is
  radial mount)" -> See below.

 "Viewing angle phi (degrees; For retina 0 is flat/radial mount)" ->
  See below	

 "Drawing scale (microns/pixel):"

 "Method to size the histology window to cells"
   -> Menu option allows for entering window parameters (see below).

 "Create new histology window?" 

 "Change histology rendering details" -> this brings up a menu which
  may include the following:

      "Label/Mark all cell nodes?"

      "Label/Mark plotted nodes?" -> This can be used without drawing 
      the cells to update newly chosen or deleted plotted nodes.

      "Draw/Label sources on cells?"

      "Channel graphics menu"

      "Synapse stimulus/RF graphics menu" 

      "Draw only proximal segments?" -> prompts for the number of 
      proximal segments out from the soma to draw, for each dendritic 
      trunk.

      "Modify element graphics"


If menu-based window sizing is chosen, then another menu appears with:

 "Center of window along X direction [um]:" 
 "Center of window along Y direction [um]:"
 "Histology window width [um]" 
 "Histology window height [um]"

For mouse and keyboard senstive actions for plot windows, see
histology-control.doc


****************************************************************

		Cell 2D Projections

****************************************************************
****************************************************************

Projecting 3D structures onto the histology window is a two part
process: The first step is the calculation of the 2D projection of the
structure, and the second step is the translation of the projection
within the plane of the display window

The anatomical information for each cell component is referenced to an
XYZ coordinate system, with an implicit origin at (0,0,0). In this
discussion we shall refer to the viewing plane as the X'Y' plane. The
default orientation of this plane is such that X->X' and Y->Y'. The
orientation of this XYZ system with respect a given brain structure is
arbitrary, but as a general rule the typical anatomic/experimental
view is corresponds to the default X'Y' projection. Typically, this
means that Z is taken as the depth within tissue, oriented with
respect to 2-dimensional sheets in brain. For example with retina, the
XY plane is congruent with the plane of the retina, with the Z axis
aligned along the radial dimension (for example, Z=0 at the ILM and
increasing in the distal direction). Thus the default orientation of
the X'Y' viewing plane corresponds to the retinal whole mount
configuration, or retinotopic orientation. For flattened cortex, the
XY plane is congruent with the surface of the brain, and the Z axis
crosses the cortical layers. For cortical and hippocampal slice
preparations, the XY plane is in the plane of the slice, since the
slice is typically viewed "en-face".  This is also the system for
cortical neurons that are typically viewed perpendicular to the
cortical surface.

Two dimensional projections onto the X'Y' viewing plane are taken as
follows.  Assume that the XYZ coordinates are placed with the XZ plane
in the horizontal direction, with the Z axis emerging from the page
and the X axis pointing to the right in the plane of the page. The Y
axis points up in the plane of the page.  Start with THETA = PHI = 0,
where the X'Y' viewing plane is congruent with the XY plane. As the
X'Y' plane is rotated about the Y' axis (now = Y axis), the azimuth
angle PHI is the angle between the X and X' axises. Next, the X'Y'
plane is rotated around the X' axis, and the elevation angle THETA is
the angle between the Y and Y' axises. When a structure is drawn, the
THETA and PHI values for the appropriate window are used to generate
the 2D representation of each element in the structure.

Subsequent translation of the cell drawing in the viewing plane with
respect to the histology window is done via the XY (really X'Y')
center parameter menu described above. Rotation of the projected
image, per se, is not implemented.

If either the viewing theta or phi is non-zero, the viewing angles
will be displayed in the lower right corner. This label may be removed
(or added to) via the (Control-t) text command described above.

****************************************************************

      Depth Relations are Not Rendered Faithfully

****************************************************************
****************************************************************

As a compromise to efficiency, there is no attempt to maintain depth
relationships between overlapping sections of the dendritic tree or
soma. For example, when two sections of the tree with two different
color overlap, the choice of which section is drawn "in front of" the
other is arbitrary. Somas are drawn either completely behind or
completely in front of the dendritic trees, selectable from the
Histology Menu, or not at all (also selectable from the Histology
Menu).

****************************************************************
****************************************************************

              Hints for Rotating Zoom Views

****************************************************************
****************************************************************

If you want to look at a zoomed view from a different angle (theta,
phi), then bring up the Histology menu on the zoom window, specify the
desired angles, and make sure to click the "Fix" or "Menu" option for
"Method to size the histology window to cells".


****************************************************************
****************************************************************

		Window Resizing

****************************************************************
****************************************************************

The current code does an incomplete job in sizing the graphics window
properly, especially with respect to visualization of light stimulus
or synapse receptive fields.  Typically, though, use of the "Fix" or
"Menu" options, instead of the "Automatic" option in the Drawing Menu
will give you enough freedom to fix the picture. If the automatic
window scaling is inappropriate you can adjust the size of the window
by the following steps:

	1. Resize the window with the mouse and the X window manager.
	The graphics will not readjust to this resizing, so you have
	to judge what the correct size will be.

	2. Invoke the Cell Drawing menu (from Surf-Hippo Main Menu, or
	CONTROL-m on the graphics window).

	3. Choose option "Fix" for "Method to size histology window to
	cells" and hit "OK".

	6. The histology will now be redrawn centered on the
	resized window.

If an histology window is resized with the window manager, various
graphics (including the highlighting of selected cell segments or
somas) will be incorrect until the cell(s) are redrawn as just
described.

The maximum size of a histology window is 90% of the screen width and height - thus
if the chosen scale is too large then the cell drawing may be cut off.

*******************************************************************

   Element Visualization - Sources, Channels, Synapses, Branches

*******************************************************************
*******************************************************************

Circuit elements can be highlighted on the histology rendering by
choosing the appropriate options in the menus. For channels and
synapses, different color markers may be assigned to different channel
or synapse types (via "Change Histology Rendering Details" option).

With the "Mark specific branches" option in the histology rendering
details, specific branches may be marked along their length with
different colors. If you have chosen a segment prior to calling the
Histology Menu, then the Mark Specific Branches option will default to
the branch associated with that segment.

You can also assign colors to specific segments with the following
function:

	color-segment SEGMENT COLOR

where COLOR can be: 'RED, 'GREEN, 'BLUE, 'YELLOW, 'ORANGE, 'CYAN,
'PURPLE, 'BLACK, or 'WHITE. For example:

	(COLOR-SEGMENT 54 'orange)

or
	
	(loop for segment in (segments-to-soma 234) do (COLOR-SEGMENT segment 'green))

Light Synapse Receptive Field Graphics

******************************************
******************************************

The receptive fields for light synapses can be drawn in perspective by the
appropriate selection in the Synapse Stimulus/RF Graphics submenu of the Drawing
menu. The receptive field graphics shapes are determined by various simple
approximations of the 'SPATIAL-RF-FUNCTION component of the synapse type parameters
(see GET-SPATIAL-RF-ARRAY in synapse.lisp). Connection lines are drawn from the
synapse to its RF, at a height that can be specific to the synapse type (default
100.0 um). The style of these lines is determined by the global variables:

	*SYN-RF-CONNECTION-DASH* (default '(10 10), see linestyles.doc for options)
 
	*SYN-RF-CONNECTION-THICKNESS* (default 0, see linestyles.doc for options)

	*SYN-RF-CONNECTION-SHADING* (default 100, see linestyles.doc for options)

These may also be set from the histology submenus. The color of the synapse marker
on the soma or segment is also the color used for the RF, with a shading given by
the global variable *SYN-RF-SHAPE-SHADING* (in percent, default 25). If
*SYN-RF-SHAPE-SHADING* is 0, then only the outline of the RF is drawn.

See the description of SET-TYPE-GRAPHICS below.

Synapse stimuli are drawn either behind or in front of the cell drawing, according to
the global variable *WHERE-SYNAPSE-STIMULUS-GOES* (:BACK or :FRONT). This may also be
set in the synapse graphics menu for the current graphics window.

	Window Visibility

******************************************
******************************************

Normally, output windows (plotting and histology) will be
automatically deiconified, raised and made visible when needed. For
automatic runs, it sometimes convenient to suppress the showing of
output so that you can do something else with the computer. Setting
the following global variables (all of whom have a default value of T)
may then help (surf-hippo/src/sys/windows-hack.lisp):

	*RAISE-OUTPUT-WINDOWS*
	*DEICONIFY-OUTPUT-WINDOWS*
	*UPDATE-OUTPUT-WINDOWS*
	*SHOW-OUTPUT-WINDOWS*

(in cell-graphics.lisp)


	set-type-graphics TYPE VALUE &optional (PARAMETER 'COLOR) (WIN *STANDARD-GRAPHICS-OUTPUT*)

SET-TYPE-GRAPHICS Sets graphic qualities for element types (e.g. channels and synapses),
and specifically enables the graphics of the type, e.g.:

     (SET-TYPE-graphics 'DR-HH 'cyan) 

or

     (SET-TYPE-graphics 'DR-HH 'cyan 'color)

For colors, possible colors include: 'RED, 'GREEN, 'BLUE, 'YELLOW, 'ORANGE, 'CYAN, 'PURPLE, 'BLACK, 'WHITE.
Valid PARAMETER arguments include 'COLOR, and 'HEIGHT (for light synapse rf plotting).


	set-misc-histo-slots &key (WIN *STANDARD-GRAPHICS-OUTPUT*)

This could happen, for example, when the 

	"Size histology window to cells" 

option is marked T for a 

	"Drawing scale (microns/pixel):" 

value that is too small.
