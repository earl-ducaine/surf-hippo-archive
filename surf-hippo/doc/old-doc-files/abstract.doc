The Surf-Hippo Neuron Simulator

The Surf-Hippo Neuron Simulator is a circuit simulation package for
investigating morphometrically and biophysically detailed models of
single neurons and small networks of neurons. Surf-Hippo allows ready
construction of multiple cells from various file formats (e.g. that
used by the Hines NEURON simulator, [De Schutter, TINS 1992]), or with
easily written LISP code, any of which can describe complicated
dendritic trees in 3-space with distributed non-linearities and
synaptic contacts between cells. The retention of XYZ coordinates for
each circuit node may be exploited, for example, by simulations which
use spatially-coded input, or with multiple cell simulations that have
contacts between cells defined by spatial proximity. Stationary and
moving two dimensional input (e.g. light, for retinal simulations
[Borg-Graham and Grzywacz, 1992]) is also provided. Multi-compartment
intracellular calcium accumulation is provided for modelling
calcium-dependent processes (e.g. Ca++ dependent K+ channels). An
extensive user interface is provided, including menus, 3D graphics of
dendritic trees, on-line addition and modification of circuit
elements, and data plotting (including camera-ready Postscript
output). Data files may also be saved for analysis with external
tools.

Surf-Hippo (available by anonymous ftp from ftp.ai.mit.edu or
cogni.iaf.cnrs-gif.fr [pub/surf-hippo]) is written in LISP, and is
configured to run using the public domain CMU Common Lisp and Garnet
packages. Our version is compiled for SPARC workstations, and should
be easily ported to other UNIX machines running X. LISP is a useful
simulator language because it has the benefits of a powerful
interpreted script language, but it may also be compiled. Thus it is
convenient to integrate custom code into Surf-Hippo. The simulator may
also be used with a minimum of programming expertise, if desired.
