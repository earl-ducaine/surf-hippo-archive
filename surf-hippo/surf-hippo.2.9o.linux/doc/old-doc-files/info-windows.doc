A special Information Window may be generated and detailed circuit
information will be printed out in the Lisp Listener or Information
Window, if the appropriate flags are checked in [Main Simulation Menu:
<Modify overall simulation parameters> <Specify information output
parameters> [Simulation Info]]. If a file from a previous simulation
has been written, then the name of this file will appear in the menu
title.

Surf-Hippo will dump simulation/circuit information to either this
type of window and/or the Lisp Listener (e.g. in the terminal window
or the Ilisp window). The advantage of the output to a Lisp Listener
is efficiency, and if this is Ilisp or other editor-based window, then
the output can be readily edited. The advantage of the Information
Window is that this can be hardcopied in the same manner as the
Plotting windows. From within the Information
Window:

 CONTROL-p will prompt for printing the selected window (and the
 others). 

 CONTROL-d will destroy the selected window (after prompting for
 verification).


These windows scroll, and may be resized by hand. Printing an
Information Window will result in an image (.ps file) that includes
only the part of the window that is visible on the screen. If part of
the information is not visible, and you want a complete record, then
select the output to information file option (see files.doc).
