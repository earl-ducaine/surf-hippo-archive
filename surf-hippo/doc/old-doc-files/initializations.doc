	Initial Values for Voltages and Concentrations

****************************************************************
****************************************************************



Two variables may be used to set initial node voltages and concentration integrator concentrations:

	*INIT-VALUE-LIST* [default NIL]
	*CONC-INT-INIT-VALUE-LIST* [default NIL]

The first is a list of pairs, the CAR's of which are nodes, the CADR's of which are the initial
voltage to set that node to. The second is a list of lists, the CAR's being concentration
integrators, and the CADR's being lists of compartment initial concentrations to set that
integrator to.

The function

	set-*init-value-list*

grabs the current node voltages and stores them in *INIT-VALUE-LIST*. Likewise, the function

	set-*conc-int-init-value-list*

grabs the current concentration integrator values and stores them in *CONC-INT-INIT-VALUE-LIST*.

The variables

	*USE-INIT-VALUE-LIST* [default NIL]
	*USE-CONC-INT-INIT-VALUE-LIST* [default NIL]

enable the use of the initialization value lists. These options may be set by the Initialization
menu [Main Simulation Menu: <Modify overall simulation parameters> 
<Menu for voltage and concentration integrator initializations>.

Note that the initial state of voltage and concentration dependent gating particles are set by
their steady state values determined by the initial values of the appropriate voltages or
concentrations.

	Virtual Holding Potentials

****************************************************************
****************************************************************

Normally, the voltage of each node at the begining of the simulation is set to the appropriate
reversal potential of the leak conductance. Voltage dependent elements may also reference a
"virtual" holding potential at the begining of the simulation.This is called a virtual holding
potential since the actual voltage of the node is not changed. The effect is as if the node
was voltage clamped from negative infinity time at the holding potential (and all other nodes
clamped to either their virtual holding potential or their leak reversal potential), and then
at time 0 there was an instantaneous and zero duration voltage clamp to the leak reversal
potential for all nodes.

Virtual holding potentials may be set from the Initialization menu, or to set the virtual
holding potential for an element use the function ELEMENT-HOLDING-POTENTIAL. If VALUE (in
mV) is supplied, this function sets the 'HOLDING-POTENTIAL parameter of the circuit node
associated with ELEMENT and returns VALUE (converted to double-float). Otherwise, it
returns the current value of the 'HOLDING-POTENTIAL parameter for the node, if that value
has been set previously.

	element-holding-potential ELEMENT &optional VALUE

To cancel the virtual holding potential, use

	(element-holding-potential some-element NIL)


Note that setting a virtual holding potential for an element will do the same for any other
element at the same node.
