# Sample code for bashrc initializations, to be added to your .bashrc
# file. This example assumes that Surf-Hippo is installed in the
# directory /home/surf-hippo.

export SURFHOME="/home/surf-hippo/"

export SURFUSERHOME="/home/surf-hippo/"   # Edit this line to a directory that you can write to.


# This if for the Lisp.

export CMUCL_EMPTYFILE="/tmp/empty"

# (From the Garnet instructions)
# Lisp requires very large address spaces.  We have found on many Unix
# systems, that you need to expand the area that it is willing to give
# to a process.  The following commands work in many systems (but not
# under bash?).

# unlimit datasize
# unlimit stacksize
