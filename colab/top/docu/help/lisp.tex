\colab{} \lisp:

Format: \stmt{lisp}
        \stmt{lisp $<$exp$>$}

Options: $<$exp$>$ a lisp-evaluable expression

Effect: If \stmt{lisp} is used without argument colab is abandoned and a
        switch to Lisp is carried out.
        If \stmt{lisp} is used with a lisp-evaluable expression, this 
        expression is evaluated in Lisp and after returning the value 
        the system goes back to Colab.
