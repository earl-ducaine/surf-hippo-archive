\az:

Format: \stmt{az $<$clause$>$}

Options: $<$clause$>$ a \COLAB{} clause

Effect: The rule $<$clause$>$ will be inserted at the end of one of the (possibly 
        empty) \FORWARD{} databases \stmt{*rule-database*} (containing the bidirectional 
	rules with tag \stmt{rl} and the forward rules with tag \stmt{up}) or \stmt{*fact-base*} 
        (containing only facts) where the tags \stmt{fact} and \stmt{attrterm} are substituted
	by the tag \stmt{hn} in order to provide this database for the 
	\RELFUN-Interpeter.
