This file describes the concentration integrators and associated pumps
and buffers. See also initializations.doc.

Documentation not complete. Refer also to source code in conc-part.lisp,
conc-int.lisp, buffer.lisp, and pump.lisp.

IMPORTANT: Although the system is general, only the calcium
concentration integrator definition supplied with the generic HPC
model (which includes instantaneous buffering and a membrane pump) has
been well tested.

	Layout for Concentration Integrators

******************************************************
******************************************************


Concentration integrators are comprised of 1 to 3 variable
concentration compartments or shells, and possibly a constant
concentration "core". Integrators may be either intracellular or
extracellular, and are "fed" from channels or synapses whose ionic
species include the species specific to the integrator in question.



Possible structure of the compartments include:


				   
	       ======= membrane ======
		       shell-1
	       -----------------------

	       ======= membrane ======
		       shell-1
	       -----------------------
		       shell-2
	       -----------------------

	       ======= membrane ======
		       shell-1
	       -----------------------
		       shell-2
	       -----------------------
		       shell-3
	       -----------------------


				   
	       ======= membrane ======
		  shell-1  | shell-2
	       -----------------------
		       shell-3
	       -----------------------


				   
	       ======= membrane ======
		  shell-1  | shell-2
	       -----------------------
		       shell-3
	       -----------------------
			 core
	       -----------------------

Pore Current and Concentration Integrator Shells

******************************************************
******************************************************


A proportion of the ionic current through channels or synapses is assigned to either
shell-1 and/or shell-2, according to the :SHELL-1-PORES and :SHELL-2-PORES slots of
the integrator. These slots in turn are set when channels or synapses are created,
according to the :CONC-INT-TYPE-PARAMS slots of the appropriate channel or synapse
types. The list in these slots is set for each ion that passes through the channel
or synapse type, and includes an entry for a concentration integrator type, for the
shell (1 and/or 2) and the proportion of the current associated with the shell,
e.g.:

  '((CA-INTRA (1 0.7) (2 0.24)) (K-EXTRA (1 1)))

The diffusion between compartments is calculated according to the shared area between the
compartments and the diffusion constant for each pair of compartments. 

The (effective) diffusion area between the juxtamembrane shells 1 and 2 is computed by the
formula:

  (* (conc-int-type-interdigitation-coefficient type) ; 1/microns
     area			                      ; surface area of the element (segment or soma) square cm
     (conc-int-type-juxtamembrane-shell-thickness type))) ; microns

The idea is that the shell next to the membrane is divided up into subregions, each of
which belongs to one of two groups (called shell 1 or 2). A group is distinguished by a
unique set of channels or synapses which traverse the membrane over a given subregion.
Thus, the concentration in the set of subregions comprising shell 1 or 2 is evaluated over
the total volume of the subregions, including the contributions of all the channels or
synapses assigned to the appropriate shell. Diffusion between shell 1 and 2 depends of an
effective diffusion area which conceptually depends on the relative interdigitation or
dispersion of the subregions. This interdigitation, or partitioning, is quantified by the
concentration integrator type :INTERDIGITATION-COEFFICIENT [1/microns], and transforms the
surface area of the membrane into an effective length or border between the subregions, as
expressed in the formula above.

The diffusion area between the juxtamembrane shell 1 and shell 3 is given by the product of
the :ALPHA-S slot of the concentration integrator type and the surface area of the element
(segment or soma). The diffusion area between the juxtamembrane shell 2 and shell 3 is
given by the product of 1 minus the value in the :ALPHA-S slot of the concentration
integrator type and the surface area of the element (segment or soma).


The volume of shell 1 is given by the product of the :ALPHA-S slot of the concentration
integrator type, the surface area of the element (segment or soma), and the thickness of
the juxtamembrane shell (the :JUXTAMEMBRANE-SHELL-THICKNESS slot of the concentration
integrator type).

The volume of shell 2 is given by the product of 1 minus the value in the :ALPHA-S slot of
the concentration integrator type, the surface area of the element (segment or soma), and
the thickness of the juxtamembrane shell.

The volume of the inner shell 3 is given by the product of the surface area of the element
(segment or soma), and the thickness of the inner shell (the :INNER-SHELL-THICKNESS slot of
the concentration integrator type).

    
When a concentration integrator is assigned to a node that already has concentration
particle(s) associated with it, then that integrator is assigned to all the previously
defined concentration particles. If a concentration particle is at a node without a
concentration integrator, then the concentration used for evaluating that particle is given
by the global variable *CA-CONC-INTRA.




******************************************************
******************************************************

	Data Plotting

******************************************************
******************************************************

Any of the shell concentrations may be plotted according to the global variables

	*PLOT-CONC-1-INTS*  -> Shell 1
	*PLOT-CONC-2-INTS*  -> Shell 2
	*PLOT-CONC-3-INTS*  -> Shell 3
	*PLOT-CONC-INTS*    -> Average concentration over the entire
			       volume of the associated cell element

each of which is a list of concentration integrator names. In the last case, the average
concentration of X is calculated with

	
  V_1 * [X]_1  +  V_2 * [X]_2  +  V_3 * [X]_3  +  V_core * [X]_core
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
                  V_1  +  V_2  +  V_3  +  V_core

  
Where V_a and [X]_a refer to the volume of shell a and the concentration of [X] in shell a,
respectively. This "total" concentration may be compared to that measured by flourescent
probes in which it is assumed that the concentration of some species is integrated over the
entire volume of a section of neuron.

When the global variable *PLOT-TOTAL-CONCENTRATIONS-SEPARATELY* is T, then a separate
plotting window is generated for the average (or "total") concentrations. This is useful
when the magnitude of the juxtamembrane shell concentrations is much larger than that of
the concentration averaged over the entire cell-element volume.

	Instantaneous Buffers

******************************************************
******************************************************


The :SHELL-INSTANTANEOUS-BUFFER-RATIOS slot is a list that defines properties of
instantaneous buffers for each shell:

     `( (SHELL RATIO) (SHELL RATIO) ...), for example -   ((1 100)(2 200)(3 1000))

where RATIO is the dimensionless ratio of bound[X]/[X] in that shell. Shells not included in this list,
or with a ratio of NIL, are assumed not to have an instantaneous buffer.

The :INSTANTANEOUS-BUFFER-P slot enables the instantaneous shell buffers.


******************************************************
******************************************************

	Other Buffers

******************************************************
******************************************************

Not tested.


******************************************************
******************************************************

	Concentration Integrator Channel or Synapse Delta Parameter

******************************************************
******************************************************



An additional parameter $\delta$, assigned to specific pore elements
(channels or synapses) which feed concentration integrators, is a
scaling coefficient (less than 1) for the integrated current.
As a first approximation, $\delta$ is estimated by the ratio of the
actual somatic conductance of a channel divided by the total
conductance of the channel for the entire cell.

For example - 

* (get-element-parameter "HPC-soma-CA-T-GEN"  'conc-int-delta)
0.34


This parameter may be assigned after channels are created, for
example:


	(loop for ch in (channels) when (element-of-ion-type-p ch 'ca)
	      do (set-element-parameter ch 'conc-int-delta 0.34)
		 (set-conc-integrators-parameters))


The final call to SET-CONC-INTEGRATORS-PARAMETERS makes sure that the
appropriate concentration integrators are setup properly.

This parameter is also discussed in channel.doc.


******************************************************
******************************************************

Defining Concentration Integrator Types with the CONC-INT-TYPE-DEF Macro

******************************************************
******************************************************

The CONC-INT-TYPE-DEF macro, discussed in element-type-libraries.doc,
creates an entry in the parameter library for concentration integrator
types. For now, the only tested classes of concentration integrator
types include the :MULTI-SHELL and :FIRST-ORDER-SINGLE-COMPARTMENT. An
example of the first type is given in the following CONC-INT-TYPE-DEF:


(conc-int-type-def
  '(CA-IN-GEN
    (class . :MULTI-SHELL)
    (species . CA)
    (intra-p . T)
    (shell2-p . T)
    (shell3-p . T)
    (juxtamembrane-shell-thickness . 1.0)
    (inner-shell-thickness . 0.0)
    (alpha-s . 10.0e-5)
    (interdigitation-coefficient . 1.0)
    (D-12 . 8.0e-6)
    (D-13 . 0.0)
    (D-23 . 8.0e-6)
    (D-12core . 0.0)
    (D-3core . 0.0)
    (transmembrane-concentration . 2.0)
    (core-conc . 0.00105)
    (PUMP-TYPE-PARAMS . ((CA-JAFFE-94 2)))
    (resting-free-conc . 5.0e-5)
    (instantaneous-buffer-enabled . T)
    (shell-1-instantaneous-buffer-ratio . 20.0)
    (shell-2-instantaneous-buffer-ratio . 20.0)
    (shell-3-instantaneous-buffer-ratio . 20.0)
    (global-instantaneous-buffer-ratio . 20.0)
))

The RESTING-FREE-CONC entry is in mM, and is the concentration of free
ion after taking into account any instantaneous buffer. The
TRANSMEMBRANE-CONCENTRATION and the CORE-CONC are also in mM These
latter two concentrations are total concentrations of the ion - if
there is no entry for RESTING-FREE-CONC, then the value for CORE-CONC
is used, even though this is not intended to be the free
concentration. The units for the diffusion parameters, D-ij, are in
cm^2 sec^-1. Shell thicknesses are in microns. Note that in this
particular model the core has no effect on the concetrations in the
other compartments, first because the values for D-12CORE and D-3CORE
are both zero, and by convention when the value for
INNER-SHELL-THICKNESS is 0.0, then the inner compartment occupies the
entire remaining cell element volume, as described above, somewhat
cryptically, in the table for compartment volumes (the volumes for
shell 3 and the core when D-INNER = 0).

The PUMP-TYPE-PARAMS entry is a list of pump types and the associated
integrator compartments. In this example, the pump type CA-JAFFE-94 is
assigned to the shell comparment 2.

For the intantaneous buffer parameters, in the example above the entry
for GLOBAL-INSTANTANEOUS-BUFFER-RATIO is redundant, since the same
value is defined for SHELL-1-INSTANTANEOUS-BUFFER-RATIO,
SHELL-2-INSTANTANEOUS-BUFFER-RATIO, and
SHELL-3-INSTANTANEOUS-BUFFER-RATIO.

An example of the :FIRST-ORDER-SINGLE-COMPARTMENT concentration
integrator type is given in the following CONC-INT-TYPE-DEF (from
src/parameters/traub91-channels.lisp):

(conc-int-type-def
 `(ca-in-traub91
   (class . :first-order-single-compartment)
   (species . ca)
   (valence . 2)
   (intra-p . t)
   (alpha-s . 1.0)
   (shell2-p . nil)
   (shell3-p . nil)
   (tau . 13.33)			; ms 
   (juxtamembrane-shell-thickness . 1.0) ; microns - this will be adjusted for each compartment
   (core-conc . 0.0e-5))		; mM
 )


Another example of this :CLASS may be found in src/parameters/warman94-channels.lisp.
    

******************************************************
******************************************************

	Pumps

******************************************************
******************************************************


Pumps are initialized according to the resting free concentration in
the associated concentration integrator compartment. This value is
used *even* if concentation integrator values are initialized with
*CONC-INT-INIT-VALUE-LIST* (see initializations.doc).

******************************************************
******************************************************

Defining Pump Types with the PUMP-TYPE-DEF Macro

******************************************************
******************************************************

The PUMP-TYPE-DEF macro, discussed in element-type-libraries.doc,
creates an entry in the parameter library for pump types. For now, the
only well tested type is a Michaelis-Menton type pump, CA-JAFFE-94,
defined with the following PUMP-INT-TYPE-DEF:


(pump-type-def
 `(CA-JAFFE-94
   (class . :MM)
   (v-max . 6.0e-11)
   (kd . 0.01)
   (species . CA)
   (qten . 1.0)
   (reference-temp . 27.0)
   ))


Other types are in src/parameters/pumps.lisp.



Note that pump types and pumps are typically created automatically,
when a concentration integrator type or associated integrators are
created whose parameter library definitions reference a particular
pump type.
